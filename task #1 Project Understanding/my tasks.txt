1. Client background

Before attempting to complete this task, you should take your time to fully understand the client brief. 

2. Internal background

After this, you should read through the organization map and each individual's role and responsibilities. This will give you a holistic understanding of the Accenture team working on this project and each individuals’ role and responsibilities. 

3. Project understanding

Once you’ve read these resources, make sure you have a confident understanding of the following three questions:

What is the business problem that Accenture is trying to tackle for this client?
Based on this business problem, what are the requirements that Accenture is expected to deliver?
Finally, based on these requirements, what tasks are most likely to be relevant to you as the data analyst?
After reading the first two documents, you should be able to construct an answer to the 3 above questions.

You do not need to submit a written answer to these questions as your knowledge will be tested by multiple-choice questions.
